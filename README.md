# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in California using a dataset with 20,640 records and 8 features. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts housing prices based on various features. The dataset is clean with no null values, and z-score capping is used for outlier removal. The project employs both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Linear Regression models.
